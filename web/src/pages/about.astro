		<h1>Email Comparison</h1>

		<h2>What</h2>
		<p>
			The aim of Email-Comparison is to provide an objective comparison of so-called
			private and/or secure email services, so that you can make an informed decision
			about which provider to use.
		</p>

		<hr>

		<h2>Where</h2>
		<p>
			The official version of this site is hosted at
			<a href="https://email-comparison.as93.net">email-comparison.as93.net</a><br>
			The source, plus all data is on GitHub at
			<a href="https://github.com/lissy93/email-comparison">github.com/lissy93/email-comparison</a>
		</p>

		<hr>

		<h2>How</h2>
		<p>
			We do not recommend any particular provider, but simply display (what we know as) the facts about each.
			It is up to you to do your own research, and make a decision based on your personal threat model and requirements.
		</p>

		<hr>

		<h2>Why</h2>
		<p>
			We put enormous trust in our email provider, it's the gateway to all our
			other online accounts, personal communications and real-life administration.
		</p>
		<p>
			At this point, it's a known fact that many mainstream email providers
			(like Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, GMX and more) offer us a free service because they
			are getting something far more valuable in return: our data.
			Maybe this doesn't bother you, after all, you've got nothing to hide, right?<br>
			But using these services, mean that how our personal data is handled and used
			is out of your control. You do not know who it's being sold to,
			which AI algorithms it's being fed into, which governments it's being shared with,
			or even how it's being used to manipulate you.

		<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
		<p>
			I have a particular interest in privacy, security and cryptography.
			And as such, it's important to note that I have worked with or for several
			of the providers listed on this site, as well as several others not included here.
			BUT none of the information here is based on my personal opinion or experience - just facts.
