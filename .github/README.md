## About

The aim of Email-Comparison is to provide an objective comparison of so-called private and/or secure email services, so that you can make an informed decision about which provider to use.

This is a community-maintained resource, so if you spot something that should be updated/added/removed, please submit a pull request or raise an issue. Or share your thoughts and feedback for an email provider, by writing a short review.

- 📧 All data is stored in [`email-provider-data.yml`](https://github.com/Lissy93/email-comparison/blob/master/email-provider-data.yml) (in YAML format).
- 🌐 Website published to [email-comparison.as93.net](https://email-comparison.as93.net/) is built with Lit on Astro.
- ⭐ All mail service reviews are submitted [here, via GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/Lissy93/email-comparison/discussions/categories/reviews).
