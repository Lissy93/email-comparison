## About

The aim of Email-Comparison is to provide an objective comparison of so-called private and/or secure email services, so that you can make an informed decision about which provider to use.

This is a community-maintained resource, so if you spot something that should be updated/added/removed, please submit a pull request or raise an issue.

All data is stored in [`email-provider-data.yml`](https://github.com/Lissy93/email-comparison/blob/master/email-provider-data.yml) (in YAML format).
